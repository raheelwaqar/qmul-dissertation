**Analysis of TFL data**

This project involves formulating concrete questions about public transit, and then carrying out
the necessary data analysis using publicly available data sets such as the extensive dataset(s)
provided by Transport for London.

The main aim of this research was to establish a comprehensive framework for examining and understanding disruptions within transportation networks. By utilizing centrality metrics, the study provided insights into the relative significance of network stations and their roles in maintaining the network's functionality. These centrality metrics proved to be invaluable tools for identifying critical nodes and gaining insights into network resilience.

Furthermore, the inclusion of Kendall's Tau correlation coefficient expanded our analytical capabilities, allowing for the comparison of centrality rankings across various disruption scenarios. The resulting Kendall's Tau distance matrix enabled us to quantify the dissimilarity between these scenarios, facilitating the exploration of patterns and trends within the disruption data.

To further enhance our analysis, we transformed the Kendall's Tau distance matrix into linkage matrices, which in turn enabled hierarchical clustering analysis. This analysis produced dendrograms that visually represented the clustering of disruption days. These dendrograms served as valuable tools for identifying clusters, sub-clusters, outliers, and anomalies within the disruption data. The hierarchical clustering approach proved to be a powerful method for uncovering underlying structures in complex disruption datasets..
