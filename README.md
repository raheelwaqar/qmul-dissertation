**Analysis of TFL data**

This project involves formulating concrete questions about public transit, and then carrying out
the necessary data analysis using publicly available data sets such as the extensive dataset(s)
provided by Transport for London. The project may involve a mixture of exploratory data
analysis, modeling, optimization, and inference, as well as manipulation of large data sets.
There are a number of different possibilities but examples include characterizing changing
behaviors over time as well as repeating patterns in the data e.g. detecting holidays and
weekends.
